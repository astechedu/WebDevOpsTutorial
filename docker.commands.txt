 //Details: 

1. docker –version
This command is used to get the currently installed version of docker
Ex: docker --version

2. docker pull
Usage: docker pull <image name>
This command is used to pull images from the docker repository(hub.docker.com)
Ex: docker pull ubuntu

3. docker run
Usage: docker run -it -d <image name>
This command is used to create a container from an image
Ex: docker run -it -d ubuntu

4. docker ps
This command is used to list the running containers
Ex: docker ps

5. docker ps -a
This command is used to show all the running and exited containers

6. docker exec
Usage: docker exec -it <container id> bash
This command is used to access the running container
Ex: docker exec -it fe6e370a1c9c bash

7. docker stop
Usage: docker stop <container id>

8. docker kill
Usage: docker kill <container id>

This command kills the container by stopping its execution immediately.
The difference between ‘docker kill’ and ‘docker stop’ is that ‘docker stop’ gives 
the container time to shutdown gracefully, in situations when it is taking too much 
time for getting the container to stop, one can opt to kill it
