In GitDownloader.php line 82:
                                                            
  git was not found in your PATH, skipping source download 

b. When I tryed to install laravel installer, Threw Errors (Path error)

Solutions:

  b. Run these commands in docker container


          root@5f864af62def:/var/www/html# export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.composer/vendor/laravel/installer/bin"
          root@5f864af62def:/var/www/html# source ~/.bashrc
          root@5f864af62def:/var/www/html# laravel -v

        
           source ~/.bashrc  # This for Ubuntu 20.0
           This is working.

   c.
  
           sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/wwww/html/laravel
           
           
           sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/your/project/vendor
           sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/your/project/storage


           sudo chgrp -R www-data storage bootstrap/cache
           sudo chmod -R ug+rwx storage bootstrap/cache



            cd into your Laravel project.
            sudo chmod -R 755 storage
            sudo chmod -R 755 bootstrap/cache

# Set Environment Path in linux: 

To put this folder on the PATH environment variable type

export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin"


This appends the folder to your existing PATH, however, it is only active for your current terminal session.

If you want it to be automatically set, it depends on the shell you are using. For bash, you can append this line to $HOME/.bashrc using your favorite editor or type the following on the shell

echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc

In order to check if it worked, logout and login again or execute

source ~/.bashrc



Detailed instructions:

in your ~/.bashrc add these lines:

export PATH="$PATH:~/.composer/vendor/bin"


Then reload:

source ~/.bashrc


Check if its added correctly:

echo $PATH

/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/home/web/bin:~/.compo



You probably wanted

echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc

or just

echo 'PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc

since PATH has almost certainly been exported into the environment already.




Ubuntu 20.04 setting path variable to solve laravel: command not found: 

export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin" >> ~/.bashrc

and

export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin" >> ~/.profile

than I did source ~/.bashrc and source ~/.profile to update those files. 


You probably wanted:

echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc

or just

echo 'PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
