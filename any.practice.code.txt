1. Trying to install laravel in docker container


When I was trying to install laravel in docker container.

Failed to download laravel/laravel from dist: The zip extension and unzip/7z commands are both missing, skipping.
The php.ini used by your command-line PHP is: 

      /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-sodium.ini
      
    Now trying to download from source
