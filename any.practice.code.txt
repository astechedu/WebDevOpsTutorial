Failed to download laravel/laravel from dist: The zip extension and unzip/7z commands are both missing, skipping.
The php.ini used by your command-line PHP is: 

      /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-sodium.ini
      
    Now trying to download from source

In GitDownloader.php line 82:
                                                            
  git was not found in your PATH, skipping source download 

b. When I tryed to install laravel installer, Threw Errors (Path error)
   composer require laravel/installer


Solutions: 

  a. Problem solved after installing zip and unzip using 'apt install zip unzip' command in docker container
  b. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Set Environment Path in linux: 

To put this folder on the PATH environment variable type

export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin"


This appends the folder to your existing PATH, however, it is only active for your current terminal session.

If you want it to be automatically set, it depends on the shell you are using. For bash, you can append this line to $HOME/.bashrc using your favorite editor or type the following on the shell

echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc

In order to check if it worked, logout and login again or execute

source ~/.bashrc



Detailed instructions:

in your ~/.bashrc add these lines:

export PATH="$PATH:~/.composer/vendor/bin"


Then reload:

source ~/.bashrc


Check if its added correctly:

echo $PATH

/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/home/web/bin:~/.compo



You probably wanted

echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc

or just

echo 'PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc

since PATH has almost certainly been exported into the environment already.
